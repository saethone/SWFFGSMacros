## Hyperspace Travel
Below is a modification of the Hyperspace Travel rules found on page 246 of the Edge of the Empire core rulebook. I can't recall exactly where I saw the initial idea for these rules, but someone before me dreamed them up. This assumes you are utilizing the following galaxy map: https://imgur.com/t/star_wars/U8pxPtC

Navigating even the most well documented hyperspace route entails a raft of incredibly complex calculations, which are largely handled by a ship’s navicom- puter. Although the navicomputer does the bulk of the work, a ship’s captain or, in those ships large or lucky enough to have one, its astrogator, still needs to enter coordinates and double-check the computer’s final calculations. Under ideal conditions, this requires an Easy ([DI]) Astrogation check Conditions are rarely ideal for those living on the fringes of the galaxy, and the Game Master should use the modifiers in the table below to increase the difficulty of the Astrogation roll to reflect the circumstances under which it is being made.

Once a ship is actually in hyperspace, there is little for the crew and passengers to do but sit back and enjoy the ride. While on one of the five Major Trade Routes (Perlemian Trade Route, Corellian Run, Corellian Trade Spine, Rimma Trade Route, and the Hydian Way), a ship can travel across one grid square in one day with an x1 Class hyper-drive.  Crossing a grid via a Minor Hyperlane (the smaller white lines on the map) can be done in 36 hours. Crossing a grid without a mapped hyperlane route takes 2 days. These average times are modified by a ship’s hyperdrive class, and can be further modified by the Game Master at his discretion due to complications with the Astrogation check, fluctuations in the route, outdated charts, or any other reason he sees fit.

Of course, most starships (especially civilian vessels) do not have a Class 1 hyperdrive. To determine the actual travel time of a starship, first determine the hyperdrive travel time. Then, he multiplies this travel time by the hyperdrive’s Class. So, the time for a Class 1 hyperdrive remains the same. However, a ship with a Class 2 hyperdrive would take twice as long to get somewhere, a Class 3 hyperdrive would take three times as long, and so on.

Modifiers	Description

+[BO]	The astrogator has done extra research on charts of the route.

+[BO]	Current location and destination are both on a Major Trade Route

+[SE]	Current location or destination is a half a grid or less away from a Hyperspace Lane

+[DI]	Quick Calculations or Entry into hyperspace under duress, typically while escaping from pursuit

+[DI]	Outdated, corrupt, or counterfeit navigation charts or navicomputer data.

+[DI] per grid	Current location or destination is a grid or further away from a Hyperspace Lane

+[DI]	Ship is lightly damaged (HT and ST < 1/2 of Threshold)

+[DI][DI]	Ship is heavily damaged (HT or ST > 1/2 of Threshold)

+[DI][DI][DI]	Damaged or missing astromech droid or navicomputer

+[AD][AD]	The astrogator has personally run the route recently.

+[TH]	Real-space debris is casting uncharted mass shadows in the route.

+[TH][TH]	A major celestial event impacted the route since the last charting.

Upgrade [DI]	The vessel has a faulty hyperdrive or entered hyperspace while too close to a planet.

In addition to the items in the Astrogation skill, you can use the following options for Dice Symbols

Cost	Result Options

[AD]	The character adds [BO] to his next Astrogation check when travelling on this route.

[AD][AD]	The trip is particularly smooth. Each character aboard the vessel recovers 2 strain.

[AD][AD][AD] or [TR]	The ship reaches its destination 25% faster. (This option can only be selected once per check).

[TR]	The discovery of a new shortcut grants on all future Astrogation checks to use this hyperspace route. Additionally, many organizations and individuals would be willing to pay for such a shortcut, especially if it is on a busy hyperlane.

[TH]	An energy surge from the hyperdrive inflicts one system strain on the ship.

[TH]  The character adds [SE] to his next Astrogation check when travelling on this route.

[TH][TH]	The trip is particularly rough. Each character aboard the vessel suffers 2 strain.

[TH][TH]	A piece of debris strikes the ship upon reentry and inflicts 1 hull trauma on the ship.

[TH][TH]	Mynocks attached themselves to the ship before the jump or during a realspace stopover. The ship suffers 3 system Strain. Additionally, the PCs might need to remove the mynocks themselves (see page 413 of the Edge of the Empire Core Rulebook).

[TH][TH][TH] or [DE]	On a failed check miscalculations send the ship wildly off course, and it emerges from hyperspace in a system of the GM's choosing or in deep space.

[TH][TH][TH] or [DE] On a successful check, the presence of a gravity shadow forces the ship out of hyperspace prematurely. The vessel drops out of hyperspace somewhere along the way, and the characters must attempt another Astrogation check to reach their final destination.

[DE]	The hyperdrive cuts out to avoid a gravity shadow, but it is damaged in the process. Once the vessel exits hyperspace, the hyperdrive is rendered inoperable until repaired.

[DE][DE]	The ship collides with a planet's gravity shadow or similar phenomenon. This forces the ship out of hyperspace (probably at a very inconvenient location). Further, the ship immediately suffers a Single Critical Hit with a +30 to the result on Table 7-9: Critical Hit Result (see page 244 of the Edge of the Empire Core Rulebook).

## Docking Fees and Operating Cost
Running a ship is not simply a case of buying one and flying into the sunset. They all require certain things; Fuel, Power, and Maintenance in order to function, and running a ship requires certain factors to be taken into account, like docking fees and the number of passengers and the consumables each vessel needs to support its crew.

Rather than calculate this all out by minutea though, I've come up with a system to create an Docking Fee and Operational Cost for a vehicle that covers all of these and abstracts them into a single upkeep cost.

The Docking Fee is paid once each time the ship arrives at a starport, and Operational Costs are paid each day the ship spends in hyperspace.

The Docking Fee is 50 x the Silhouette of the vessel credits. This covers the cost of the actual docking fee along with routine maintenence the ship requires. You may reduce this by 10x ship Silhouette if you spend an hour making an Average ([DI][DI]) mechanics check to do maintenance yourself. Note that this does not including repairs to Hull Trauma, which is covered on page 243 of the Edge of the Empire Core Rulebook.

The Operational Cost is 30 credits per day per Silhouette of the vessel. This covers the cost of Fuel, Power consumption, and consumables to feed crew and passengers. The total Operational Cost for the trip is paid at the time of arrival to the destination.

Note that this doesn't always narratively make sense - for example, if you arrive at a remote unpopulated world, who is there to pay a docking fee to? Please remember that this is simply an abstraction - your vessel would normally pay different rates at different docks, consume different fuel ammounts based on whether or not you did combat, or use a different amount of consumables based on how full the crew and passenger compartments were. It's simply easier to pay this at the end of each trip than to track these expenditures and discounts over multiple trips. Handling it this way allows us to spend minimal time calculating this, but still makes you consider whether its worth picking up that load of goods and hauling it across the galaxy for 500 credits of profit. 

Because this is a frequent event as well, rather than rolling Negotiation checks each time you fly anywhere, you may reduce the final cost by 5% per rank in Negotiation of the character on board with the highest Negotiation skill (provided they wish to).

These rules are loosely based on this fan supplement: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-cK7UE7hkkcTzJocVowQnJwRkk/view

## The Macro
You can use the included macro to quickly calculate the hyperspace travel time and docking fee + operational cost of your trip. All the fields should be self explanatory. Note, for simplicities sake, the travel time is rounded to the nearest tenth, and the credit cost is rounded to the nearest whole credit.
