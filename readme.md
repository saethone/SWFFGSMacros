## RandomCredits

This macro generates a random number of credits for your party. It will allow you to enter about how many credits you want to give each player and the number of players in your party (I set these at 25 and 4 by default, as I figure most mooks will have 100 credits or so on them), but of course you can change these values by editing line 3.

I then randomized that number between about half to 1.25 of what you entered just to give it a little bit of randomness - but ensures it'll always end up as a whole number. It then multiplies that number by however many players you have, lets them know how many total credits they found, and how many credits that is per player in the chat.
